Type casting in Python is the process of converting a variable from one type to another. For example, you can convert an integer to a float, a float to a string, and so on.

## Common uses
- Converting Float to Integer:
Using `int()` will convert a float to an integer. Therefore, if your variable is `1.29`, after the conversion it will be `1`.
- Converting String to Float:
Using `float()` will convert a string to a float. As a result, if your variable is `1`, after the conversion it will be `1.0`.
- Converting Integer to String:
Using `str()` will convert an integer to a string. Hence, if your variable is `5`, after the conversion it will be `"5"`.

I highly encourage you to try it  yourself using the example code in this repository.
