`*args` allows you to pass a variable number of arguments to a function. It helps when you don't know beforehand how many arguments will be passed to your function.

## Basic example without *args
In a function without `*args`, you need to define each parameter explicitly. 
```
def add(num1, num2):
    sum = num1 + num2
    return sum

print(add(2, 5))  # This will print 7
```
Here, the `add()` function expects exactly two arguments.

## Basic example with *args
With `*args`, you can handle more flexible numbers of arguments.
```
def math(*args):
    sum = 0
    for i in args:
        sum += i
    return sum

print(math(5, 7, 8))  # This will print 20
```
In this case, `math` can accept any number of arguments. `*args` collects all the arguments into a tuple, allowing the function to iterate through and sum them up.

Using *args makes your functions more versatile, letting them accept varying numbers of arguments without changing the function definition.
