Variables are used almost in every code. This is due to the versatility that they offer. Fundamentally variables are containers for storing data values, you can think of them as boxes with tags. To create a variable you just need to assign a value to it, use an equal `(=)` sign to achieve this.  For example `my_name  =  Armando`.

In Python variables can't have spaces. Therefore, you can't name a variable `my name`; instead of a space you should put an underscore `(_)`. Also, you can't start a variable name with a number; as a consequence you can't create `2name` as a variable.

In general there are many ways that programmers name variables and this has been a topic of debate that even I have discussed with my classmates more than I would like. To put this in context, there are six "famous" ways of naming a variable. First, my favorite, I have to say, is *snake_case*. It's the most pleasant for the eyes; you can read it very easily. Nonetheless, when it gets long it becomes redundant. This is why you would want to keep your variables descriptive and concise. Even if you don't like *snake_case*, you should keep your variables short and explicit. The second way is *camelCase*, I personally dislike this one. It's widely used in the community but looks ugly. The third way is called *PascalCase*. It's like *camelCase* but you capitalize every first letter. It looks neat but it's barely used; many people confuse it with *camelCase*. The fourth way is *kebab-case*. It's easy to type; normally, it is used in HTML. The fifth way is *SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE*. It's funny; you can demonstrate your anger with it. I wouldn't recommend using it at a professional level. Finally, the sixth way is *nocase*. it looks professional but is difficult to read, and to be honest it is just weird.

## Different types of variables

In python there are four types of variables:*Strings* (*str*), *Integers* (*int*), *Floats*, and *Booleans* (*Bol*). `(You don't need to declare the variable's type)`

A string is a sequence of characters that are always enclosed in either single quotes `('')` or double quotes `("")`. You can use the `+` operator to join strings,

An integer is a whole number, without a decimal point.

A float is a number that has a decimal point.

A boolean is a data type that can be either `True` or `False`.

To check the data type of a variable, use the `type()` function.

In the code, you will see at a basic overview of how to use different types of variables in Python. Understanding these fundamental types will help you manipulate and use data effectively in your programs.
