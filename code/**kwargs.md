`**kwargs` allows you to pass a variable number of keyword arguments to a function. It is useful when you want to handle named arguments dynamically.

## Basic example using **kwargs
In a function with `**kwargs`, you can accept any number of named arguments. These arguments are stored in a dictionary. For example:
```
def dictionary(**kwargs):
    print("Hello ", end="")
    for key, value in kwargs.items():
        print(value, end="")

dictionary(title="Mr. ", first="Befuzs ", last="Shisazs")
```
In this example, **kwargs collects all keyword arguments into a dictionary called kwargs. The function then prints each value provided as an argument.

## How it works
- `**kwargs` captures named arguments as a dictionary.
- Each key in this dictionary is the argument name, and the value is the corresponding argument value.
- You can access and use these arguments within your function as needed.

Using **kwargs makes your functions more flexible by allowing them to accept a varying number of named arguments, which can be useful for functions that need to handle a wide range of parameters.

## Difference between *args and **kwargs
`*args` and `**kwargs` handle different types of function arguments. `*args` allows a function to accept an arbitrary number of positional arguments, which are collected into a tuple. This is useful when the number of arguments is not known beforehand. On the other hand, `**kwargs` allows a function to accept an arbitrary number of keyword arguments (A.K.A, named arguments), which are collected into a dictionary. This helps when you want to pass varying keyword arguments to a function. Essentially, `*args` handles unnamed, positional arguments, while `**kwargs` handles named, keyword arguments.
