String methods are built-in functions that we can used to perform a wide range of operations on strings. They allow us to manipulate and work with string data in different ways. In the code you, will see examples of the most commonly used string methods.

## Common string methods
- The `len()` method returns the length (the number of characters) of a string.
- The `find()` method returns the lowest index of the substring if it's found in the string. If it's not found, it returns -1.
- The `capitalize()` method returns a copy of the string with its first character capitalized.
- The `upper()` method returns the string in uppercase.
- The `lower()` method returns the string in lowercase.
- The `isdigit()` method is used to tell if a string is a digit. It returns `True` if *all* characters in the string are digits; otherwise it returns `False`.
- The `isalpha()` method returns `True` if all characters in the string are alphabetic and there are no spaces; otherwise it returns `False`.
- The `count()` method returns the number of times that a substring appears in a string.
- The `replace()` method replaces a specified substring with another specified substring.
- The `*` is used to repeat a string multiple times. Therefore, instead of wasting five lines of code to print a string, you just use one.
